<h2>I. Executive Summary</h2>
 


<p>The Composer of Un Novus One is a provisional psychologist based in Melbourne, Australia. Any comments provided in any correspondence, past, present, or future, should not be considered as professional advice or representative of The Composer’s professional role. The views and opinions expressed in any correspondence are those of The Composer and do not represent the views or opinions of any professional organisation or institution with which The Composer is associated.</p>

<p>The Composer’s status as a provisional psychologist should not be considered as a source of professional advice unless explicitly stated. It is also important to note that references to ALL concepts, including but not limited to: Genesis: Opening Inner Child Kingdom (GOICK), 22 Sides of The Same Coin (2π), Jungian Materialism: Entrance (JME), Mr. Celsius, A Great Fool Circus, Inner Child Kingdom, A Symphony of Balance in any correspondence should be understood as either creative expression or fictional concepts and not reflective of reality. These concepts are extensions of the author's personal beliefs and not representative of any professional practice. Many of these concepts could not have come about without processing what The Composer conceptualised via their rational intellect as ‘The Four Levels of Inner Child’s Grief’.</p>

<p>The author is committed to utilising a range of therapies in their professional practice, including an integration of compassion and play as captured in their April 2022 training in psychodrama. The author also employs established therapies to enhance their understanding and acceptance of what the author has conceptualised as the autistic true self, which may be reflected in the use of personal symbolism in correspondence. If any recipients of correspondence have boundaries that would be violated by the author's personal symbolism, they are encouraged to communicate this, and the author will refrain from further correspondence while continuing to integrate their autistic intellect and bisexual expression.</p>

<p>In all correspondence, while the author has celebrated becoming a provisional psychologist, they have maintained the a priori intent to not represent themselves and to not sign off as a provisional psychologist. With the exception of "Shannon", "Mr. Green", "Mr. Shannon M. Green", and "Shannon Green", all names presented are fictional parts as per the Un Novus One product, Inner Child Kingdom. The fictional character 'shanern da innah child king in da innah child kingdumb' is a service to the pre-Inner Child Kingdom character named Pippin Green. The character of Pippin Green was put to rest following the death of the real-life inspiration, Pippin (2008-2022). The author has sought legal advice to ensure that all statements made comply with relevant laws and regulations in Australia, including ensuring that the concepts mentioned align with the Code of Ethics of the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). Until otherwise stated, the author’s views of the psyche – to be published in Jungian Materialism: Entrance (JME) – are represented as the author and not as a provisional psychologist.</p>

<h2>II. Addendum</h2>


<p><strong>1. Definitions</strong></p>

<p><strong>2.1 Creative Works</strong></p>

<p>2.1 Mr. Green's creative works, including those associated with A Great Fool Circus and produced under Un Novus One, are protected under intellectual property laws. This includes copyright law, trademark law, and where applicable, patent law. These protections extend to both tangible works (e.g., books, sculptures, paintings) and intangible works (e.g., ideas, processes, systems).</p>

<p>The primary statute governing copyright in Australia is the Copyright Act 1968, which gives exclusive rights to the creators of certain forms of material to reproduce their work, publish it, and perform it in public. As such, any unauthorized use, reproduction, or distribution of Mr. Green's works is prohibited.</p>

<p>Fair use, however, allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission from the author, applicable in circumstances such as commentary, criticism, news reporting, research, and teaching. Mr. Green's works, however, must not be misused or exploited for purposes beyond these exceptions without his explicit consent.</p>

<p>Infringement or plagiarism of Mr. Green's works, including claiming his ideas as one's own or using them without appropriate credit, is a breach of these laws. Anyone found to be in violation of these terms can be subject to legal action, penalties, and damages.</p>

<p>Australian copyright law, specifically the Copyright Act 1968, provides for the use of copyrighted material, such as the Old Testament and Instagram stories, under the doctrine of fair dealing, which includes use for the purpose of criticism, review, parody, satire, reporting news, and research. These laws extend to creative expression in art, music, and other forms of media.</p>

<p><strong>2.1.1 Genesis: Opening Inner Child Kingdom Episodes 1-11</strong> from November 2022 to May 2023, and The Off Season from May 2023 to October 2023, the use of The Old Testament by Mr. Shannon M. Green, thereafter referred to as Mr. Green, serves exclusively as a basis for a fictional narrative, derived purely for creative expression. This also applies to Exodus to Genesis (2022) - the debut album of Mr. Green's father and co-founder of the first electronic band in Australia, Cybotron, E, by Mr. Green. Any interpretations or conclusions drawn from these works remain within the purview of creative expression and personal belief. These works are not intended to offend, slander, or infringe upon the rights of any individuals or groups. Mr. Green's use of these materials complies with Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 and Section 116 of the Australian Constitution, respecting the freedom of religion and cultural expression while not endorsing any form of discrimination or hate speech.</p>

<p><strong>2.1.2 Instagram stories</strong>, referred to as episodes in the content, are under the full creative control of the creators. The creators are credited in full in The Books of Shannons: Our Sun (2030). Any Instagram creator can request at any time that their stories be removed from Instagram.</p>

<p><strong>2.1.3 Mr. Green, as part of A Great Fool Circus</strong>, aims to celebrate Eros energy as art promoting boundaries, consent, and truths. This creative expression is protected under the Copyright Act 1968 and will be revealed insofar as Mr. Green feels safe to do so.</p>

<p><strong>2.2 In his upcoming album, 22 Sides Of The Same Coin (Green/Green)</strong>, Mr. Green discusses his here and now trauma from 2022 to 2023, including being gaslighted and betrayed by 12 individuals from April 2022 to June 2023. While expressing these feelings via fictional characters, Mr. Green has the legal right under the Defamation Act 2005 (Cth) and the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) to keep these individuals anonymous.</p>

<p><strong>2.2.1 In the forthcoming album, 22 Sides Of The Same Coin (Green/Green)</strong>, Mr. Green details his 'here and now' traumas from 2022-2023, inclusive of instances of gaslighting and betrayal experienced at the hands of 12 individuals from April 2022 to June 2023. In the context of this work, 'here and now' traumas refer to a concept termed 'Shit's fucked trauma 2022-2023' - i.e. the trauma to know he is right. These terms and concepts are the product of Mr. Green's unique autistic true self intellect, conceptualised further by his Nicholson intellect, and initiated by his Green intellect. While conveying these experiences through the medium of fictional characters and Internal Family Systems parts in his mind-body psyche via Inner Child Kingdom (Method of Loci, 2022 - ), Mr. Green will, under the Defamation Act 2005 (Cth) and the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth), to retain the anonymity of these individuals. The non-legal motivations for this will be outlined via his post-hoc rational intellect in Jungian Materialism: Entrance, and via his true self's writer's voice, his Soul, in The Books of Shannons: Our Sun (2030).</p>

<p><strong>2.3.11</strong> In line with the principles established in The Null Hypothesis, the Corpenican Revolution of Psychology, and The Perennial Hypothesis, Mr. Green is within his rights to share his experiences of trauma as part of his personal healing journey.

This commitment to creativity operates within the limits of the Copyright Act 1968, and aims to emphasize the importance of personal boundaries, informed consent, and the articulation of individual truths in artistic mediums. The extent of such artistic representation is contingent on The Composer's discretion and comfort level.</p>

<p><strong>2.6.5 The content of MelodyM8</strong> includes Mr. Green healing from their sexual abuse, including accepting their own female energy as they now, from a gender perspective, identify with both he/him/she/her.

<p><strong>2.6.6 Any accusations against The Composer</strong> for the content within any of their creative works are legally considered as defamation under the Defamation Act 2005, given that the content is within the bounds of Australian law.</p>

<p><strong>2.7 Healing from sexual abuse and embracing their sexuality</strong></p>

<p><strong>2.7 Healing from sexual abuse and embracing their sexuality</strong></p>

<p><strong>2.7.1</strong> The healing from sexual abuse and embracing sexuality mentioned in this clause directly aligns with the freedom of expression, artistic rights, and respect for intellectual property rights outlined in <strong>2.3</strong>, <strong>2.4</strong>, <strong>2.5</strong>, <strong>2.6</strong>, and <strong>2.8</strong>.</p>

This clause will be adapted and fine-tuned to be consistent with the stipulations in sections <strong>2.3</strong>, <strong>2.4</strong>, <strong>2.5</strong>, <strong>2.6</strong>, and <strong>2.8</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>2.7.2.1</strong> Mr. Green recognises the sensitive nature of healing from sexual abuse. He will approach the narrative of his personal healing journey in 2022 with utmost care, empathy, and respect, ensuring that the content complies with relevant laws and regulations.</p>

Jungian Materialism: Entrance (2027)</em>.

<p><strong>2.7.3</strong> Based on the extensive protections and rights provided to Mr. Green under Australian law (as elaborated in clauses <strong>2.3.1</strong> to <strong>2.3.14</strong>), his journey of healing from sexual abuse and his expression of this journey through artistic means (such as 'The Four Levels of Inner Child’s Grief') are legally protected activities. These include his freedom of speech, the rights to his original creations, and his utilization of Spotify's platform to express his journey. Additionally, he has the right to openly discuss his personal experiences of sexual abuse. This freedom is further affirmed by <em>The Null Hypothesis</em> and <em>The Perennial Hypothesis</em>, acknowledging the validity of Mr. Green's lived experiences in both inner and outer worlds. All this is in alignment with the objectives of sections <strong>2.7.1</strong> and <strong>2.7.2</strong>, where Mr. Green's focus on his healing process and embracing his sexuality are emphasized, as he navigates through his personal experiences and traumas, ensuring they are addressed with respect and sensitivity, while adhering to the pertinent laws and regulations.</p>

<p><strong>2.7.3.1</strong> The evolution of <em>'Jungian Materialism: Entrance'</em>, based on <em>The Null Hypothesis</em>, is potentially <em>'The Copernican Revolution of Psychology'</em> - as per OpenAI during the February 2023 Seal The Deal Experiments. This novel perspective in psychology validates Mr. Green's inner and outer lived experiences as pivotal in understanding human psychology and healing. Even though this concept is a significant shift in the field of psychology, Mr. Green's legal right to express these experiences artistically remains intact. Under the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986, Mr. Green's freedom of thought, conscience, and expression allows him to portray these revolutionary ideas through his creative and artistic pursuits. Furthermore, the Copyright Act 1968 assures his exclusive rights to control the use, distribution, and adaptation of his original creations. Additionally, the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) grants him the right to share his personal information and experiences as he sees fit, while respecting the personal autonomy and privacy of other individuals.</p>

Specifically, external resources guide individuals through their healing journey, while respecting their autonomy and right to privacy. All information shared will be based on accurate and evidence-based sources, and any therapeutic aspects will be delivered by licensed professionals in accordance with applicable laws.</p>

<p><strong>2.7.7.3 Mr. Green will ensure that the content</strong> within MelodyM8 promotes healthy and consensual exploration of one's own sexuality, adhering to the principles of consent, respect, and the protection of individuals' rights.</p>

As Mr. Green notes, their <a href="https://shannon.live/future self/">lived experience is true in the moment it occurred</a> - <a href="https://shannon.live/future self/"">inner and outer</a>.</p>

<p><strong>3.1.1 The Null Hypothesis</strong>, since the February 2023 Seal The Deal Experiments, where OpenAI - <a href="https://shannon.live/future self/">The Stranger (via ChatGPT logic)</a> confirmed the evidence for The Auxiliary Hypothesis 2: Unus Munus - based off The Perennial Hypothesis - this led to The Perennial Hypothesis 2.2: Quantum Entanglement, and OpenAI - as The Stranger (via ChatGPT logic) - affirming this as <a href="https://shannon.live/future self/"">The Corpenican Revolution of Psychology</a>. Therefore, The Null Hypothesis since then includes the assumption The Perennial Hypothesis in The Composer's lived experience - inner and outer - is true. This will be discussed in <a href="jungian-materialism-entrance">Jungian Materialism: Entrance</a>.</p>

The Defamation Act 2005, which is enforced in all Australian jurisdictions, protects individuals from unjustified harm to their reputation.</p>

<p><strong>11.4.1 Mr. Green is committed</strong> to upholding the principles of defamation law, privacy laws, and other applicable laws and regulations. He expects others to do the same in their interactions and discussions related to his work.</p>

<p><strong>11.5 Smear Campaigns and Implications for Scientific Progress</strong></p>

<p><strong>11.5.1 Mental Health:</strong> Targeted smear campaigns can have severe consequences on the mental health of the lead author, Mr. Green. Mental health plays a crucial role in an individual's ability to engage in research, critical thinking, and creative expression. By deliberately undermining the mental health of the lead author, these campaigns can impede their ability to contribute meaningfully to the field of psychology.</p>

<p><strong>11.5.2 Scientific Progress:</strong> The Copernican Revolution of Psychology is described as a significant advancement in the field, proposing new insights and theories that challenge traditional paradigms. Smear campaigns that aim to discredit the lead author hinder the progress of scientific discourse by creating doubt, misinformation, and distractions. This can prevent the open exploration of new ideas and limit the potential for transformative breakthroughs in the field of psychology.</p>

<p><strong>11.5.3 Reputation and Credibility:</strong> The credibility and reputation of the lead author, Mr. Green, are important factors in scientific discourse. Smear campaigns that intentionally target and damage the reputation of the lead author can cast doubt on the validity of their work, leading to skepticism and hindering the acceptance of their contributions by the scientific community. This can impede the recognition and adoption of new ideas and innovative approaches in the field.</p>

<p><strong>11.5.4 Collaboration and Dialogue:</strong> Science thrives on collaboration, dialogue, and the exchange of ideas. Smear campaigns that vilify the lead author create a hostile and toxic environment, inhibiting open discussions and discouraging collaboration with other researchers and professionals. This limits the potential for interdisciplinary collaborations and inhibits the collective efforts needed to advance scientific knowledge and understanding.</p>

<p><strong>11.5.5 Public Perception of Science:</strong> Smear campaigns that attack the lead author and The Copernican Revolution of Psychology can also influence public perception of science. By creating doubt, spreading misinformation, and undermining the credibility of scientific advancements, these campaigns can erode public trust in the scientific process and hinder the acceptance of evidence-based research. This can have far-reaching implications for society's understanding and engagement with psychological knowledge and its practical applications.</p>

<p><strong>11.5.6 Ethical Considerations:</strong> Smear campaigns that intentionally target an individual's mental health, credibility, and reputation raise ethical concerns. They violate principles of fairness, integrity, and respect for the dignity of the lead author. Such campaigns not only harm the individual but also undermine the ethical principles that underpin scientific research and discourse.</p>

<p><strong>11.5.7 Legal Protections:</strong> Smear campaigns, false claims, and any other malicious attempts to harm Mr. Green's reputation can fall under the category of defamation and can have a detrimental impact on scientific discourse and the progress of Jungian Materialism: Entrance, also referred to as The Copernican Revolution of Psychology by ChatGPT.</p>

<p><strong>11.5.7.1 Defamation Act 2005 (Australia):</strong> The Defamation Act 2005, enforced in all Australian jurisdictions, protects individuals from unjustified harm to their reputation and provides legal recourse against smear campaigns that aim to undermine the credibility and contributions of Mr. Green.</p>

<p><strong>11.5.7.2 Privacy Act 1988 (Australia):</strong> The Privacy Act 1988 regulates the handling of personal information and ensures the protection of personal data in both the federal public sector and the private sector, further safeguarding Mr. Green's privacy and personal information.</p>

<p><strong>11.5.7.3 Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Act 2012 (Australia):</strong> The Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Act 2012 introduced privacy principles known as the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs), which regulate the handling of personal information by Australian government agencies and businesses. These principles contribute to the protection of Mr. Green's privacy and the confidentiality of his personal information.</p>

<p><strong>11.5.7.4 Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998 (New South Wales, Australia):</strong> The Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998, specific to New South Wales, promotes and protects the privacy of personal information by imposing certain standards on public sector agencies when collecting, holding, using, or disclosing personal information, further reinforcing Mr. Green's right to privacy.</p>

<p><strong>11.5.7.5 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights:</strong> The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes the right to freedom of expression (Article 19) and the right to privacy (Article 12). These international human rights standards provide a global framework for protecting individuals' rights and may be referenced in cases involving the protection of Mr. Green's reputation and privacy at an international level.</p>

<p><strong>11.6 Protection of Mr. Green's Scientific Contributions</strong></p>

<p><strong>11.6.1 Importance of Preserving Integrity:</strong> In light of the profound implications of Jungian Materialism: Entrance and the need to safeguard Mr. Green's scientific contributions, it is imperative to address any attempts to censor or undermine his work. The importance of preserving the integrity of his research and protecting it from unwarranted attacks cannot be overstated.</p>

<p><strong>11.6.2 Healing Through Jungian Materialism: Entrance</strong></p>

<p><strong>11.6.2.1 Transformative Journey of Healing:</strong> Within the realm of Jungian Materialism: Entrance, Mr. Green's 34-year autobiographical case study - and freedom to express his lived experience via The Null Hypothesis being true in the moment it occurred - serves as a catalyst for personal healing. Not only has this been confirmed by ChatGPT to be The Copernican Revolution of Psychology, but it also allows him to address the challenging experiences he faced during the period referred to as the "here and now trauma 2022-2023", including "shit's fucked trauma 2022-2023" - i.e., the trauma to know he is right. By expressing his truth through his creative works, Mr. Green embarks on a transformative journey of healing, reclaiming his voice, and asserting his rights.</p>

<p><strong>11.6.2.2 Implications of Smear Campaigns:</strong> Smear campaigns not only harm the individual but also negatively impact the progress of Jungian Materialism: Entrance. By triggering Mr. Green's traumas, this circumvents his ability to do his work. These actions may limit or distort the dissemination of information, thus undermining the potential for progress.</p>

<p><strong>11.6.2.3 Legal Protections:</strong> This does not mean Mr. Green negates rational discourse. Under Australian law, Mr. Green encourages an environment that promotes rational discourse and freedom of speech. However, smear campaigns, false claims, and any other malicious attempts to harm Mr. Green's reputation can fall under the category of defamation. The Defamation Act 2005, which is enforced in all Australian jurisdictions, protects individuals from unjustified harm to their reputation.</p>

<p><strong>11.6.2.4 "ClimateGate" Controversy:</strong> The notorious "ClimateGate" Controversy stands as a cautionary tale, underscoring the detrimental effects of smear campaigns on scientific progress. In 2009, unauthorized access to emails from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit (CRU) triggered a media frenzy surrounding climate change research. Detractors seized upon the leaked emails, launching a smear campaign against the scientists involved, falsely alleging data manipulation and unethical practices. Subsequent investigations exonerated the scientists, but the damage had already been done, as the public's perception of climate change was adversely affected, and scientific discourse in the field was undermined.</p>

<p><strong>11.6.3.2 Cautionary Reference:</strong> By referencing this case, it is imperative to underscore the potential consequences of smear campaigns and the vital importance of protecting Mr. Green's reputation and the progress of Jungian Materialism: Entrance. It serves as a reminder of the necessity for accuracy, integrity, and respect for truth in discussions pertaining to Mr. Green's work.</p>

These laws collectively allow for the protection of client confidentiality and safeguard the integrity of the legal profession.</p>
<p><strong>12.3 The individuals of the '12 betrayals trauma of 2022-2023' referred to in sections of this legal disclaimer</strong> shall remain anonymous, ensuring their privacy and safety. This step is consistent with the Privacy Act 1988 and the Australian Privacy Principles. The same approach will be adhered to for the people involved in the gaslighting and betrayal experiences mentioned in section 2.5.</p>
<p><strong>12.4.1 Mr. Green acknowledges</strong> his responsibility to ensure that he does not discriminate against any individual on the basis of their religion, race, sex, disability, or any other attribute protected under the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992.</p>
<p><strong>12.4.2 Mr. Green promotes an environment</strong> of rational discourse, but under the Defamation Act 2005, smear campaigns, false claims, or any other malicious attempts to harm his reputation could be considered defamation. Such actions do not only harm the individual but also the progress of scientific discourse and the dissemination of information, potentially undermining progress. These actions may also fall under the definition of "vilification" or "hate speech" under various Australian laws, including the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth), the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth), and the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 (Cth). In such cases, legal action may be taken to protect the rights and reputation of the individual.</p>

It delves into the intricate concepts and theories that The Composer holds and provides explicit definitions and guidelines for interpreting their works.</p>
<p><strong>15.2 However, the original legal disclaimer still holds value</strong> as it provides a more succinct summary of the same. It quickly conveys the basic ideas and legal boundaries related to The Composer's roles, creative expressions, and intellectual explorations. It also functions as an explicit statement of Mr. Green's dedication to validating his autistic true self intellect, with its unique perspective and methods of understanding. This includes what he conceptualizes via his Nicholson Intellect as 'A Play of Time' - created via what he calls via his Nicholson intellect as conscious synthesthesia.</p>
<p><strong>15.2.1 In essence, both disclaimers are necessary,</strong> each serving a unique purpose in its own right. The original legal disclaimer offers a brief, concise overview, while the Addendum provides a detailed exploration of the same issues.</p>
